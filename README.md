The `bitcoinFinance` package and the `bubble` package are the companion materials for my textbook titled [Quantitative Finance with R and Cryptocurrencies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1090685319?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860). This book organizes the materials that I developed over time for the Perm Summer/Winter School on Blockchain and CryptoEconomics, as well as for my course in Numerical methods for finance using R. The book's companion website can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/quafirc). 

The `bitcoinFinance` package is a collection of functions for the financial modelling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You can install the package using the commands: 
``` {.r}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("deanfantazzini/bitcoinFinance")
```
