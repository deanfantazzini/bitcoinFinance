## bitcoinFinance

The `bitcoinFinance` package and the `bubble` package will be the companion materials for a textbook I am working on. This forthcoming book wants to
organize the materials that I developed over time for the Perm Summer/Winter School on Blockchain and CryptoEconomics, as well as for my course in Numerical
methods for finance using R.

The `bitcoinFinance` package is a collection of functions for the financial modelling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You can install the package using the commands:
``` {.r}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("deanfantazzini/bitcoinFinance")
```
