\title{Compute the bitcoin lower bound with user-delivered inputs}
\usage{
btc.lower.bound.user(
  block.reward = 12.5,
  hashing.power.miner = 10^12,
  Difficulty = 559970892890,
  price.kWh = 0.125,
  W.GHs = 0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{block.reward}{is the block reward (currently 12.5 BTC/block)}

\item{hashing.power.miner}{is the hashing power employed by a miner. Hayes (2017) sets this value to 1000 GH/s even though
the actual hashing power of a miner is likely to deviate greatly from this value.}

\item{Difficulty}{is the difficulty which is expressed in units of GH/block}

\item{price.kWh}{is the $electricity price per kWh in dollars}

\item{W.GHs}{is the energy consumption efficiency of the producerâ€™s hardware expressed in W per GH/s}
}
\value{
price.bitcoin is the bitcoin lower bound
}
\description{
